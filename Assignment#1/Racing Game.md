Racing Game

Introduction:
This is a simple console-based racing game written in C++. Players control two 
cars (CAR1 and CAR2) using 'a', 'd', 'j', and 'l' keys to move left and right. 
The game ends when one of the cars reaches the position 30.

Compilation:
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the source code file (main.cpp).
Use the following command to compile the program:
g++ main.cpp -o RacingGame
Note: If you are using a different compiler, adjust the command accordingly.

Execution:
After successful compilation, run the executable:
RacingGame
Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
Use 'a', 'd', 'j', and 'l' keys to control the cars.
Press 'q' to quit the game.

Note:
Make sure to run the program on a Windows system as it uses Windows-specific functions for sound effects.
The game may require adjustments if you intend to run it on a non-Windows system.
